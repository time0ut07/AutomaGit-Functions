## Warning


**Please ensure that your changes works before pushing**


**Ensure that you have cloned the repo and you are in the same directory**

## Usage


This script was crafted for fun and was aiming to not repeat the action of pushing into a commit during my FYP period.


Execute the file and enter the repo name, commit message, and branch name (optional)


*Do note that this script needs to be in the same directory as your repo*
